# javascript-and-api-basic
My intention with this project is to expand my JavaScript skills in order to improve my automation skills using the Cypress framework.

In this project I create:
- A "cnh" JS function with conditionals, interacting with the HTML document, treating an error when the age value is empty and sending different allerts to each age range;
- An "avengers" JS function with arrays, interacting with the HTML document and forEach repetition statement;
- HTML file with h1, input fields, buttons, ul, ids and importing JS function files;
- A local server using npm express, thunder client and npm nodemon
- API rest verions of the "cnh" and "avengers" functions
